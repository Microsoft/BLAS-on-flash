# BLAS-on-Flash Project Files
BLAS-on-Flash implements a small subset of BLAS routines (BLAS-2/3) that work with matrices/vectors stored on flash storage.
In addition to BLAS routines, BlasonFlash also provides other routines like kmeans, sort, map, reduce for large-scale processing on disk-resident data.
Currently, only the following routines are supported.
- `_gemm`
- `_csrmm`
- `_csrgemv`
- `_csrcsc`
- `sort`
- `kmeans`
- `map`
- `reduce`

# Requirements
- Ubuntu 16.04 or newer running Linux Kernel v4.13 or newer (Older kernels have issues setting `nr_requests` parameter)
- `cat /sys/block/<dev>/queue/nr_requests` is at least `32768`
- Intel MKL 2017+ is installed (usually in `/opt/intel`) and added to LD_PRELOAD path; See `CMakeLists.txt` for finer control over MKL paths
- `libaio-dev` package installed
- `make` and `cmake` installed with `cmake > 3.0.0`

# Build instructions
- `git clone ssh://git@github.com/Microsoft/BLAS-on-flash blas-on-flash`
- `cd blas-on-flash`
- `mkdir bin && cd bin`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=X ..` where `X=Debug` or `X=Release`
- `make -Bj`

BLAS-on-Flash library design, architecture, and some performance numbers can be found in [this](nsdi2019_paper.pdf) paper.
